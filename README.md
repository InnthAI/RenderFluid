# RenderFluid

**RenderFluid** is a modular, secure, and easy-to-use AI generation pipeline for ComfyUI—designed for real-world deployment in creative, commercial, and regulated environments. It brings together curated models, SFW-first safety layers, consent enforcement (via NILE), and optimized batch workflows for illustration, photo realism, and upscaling.

With RenderFluid, you can generate high-quality AI content without writing a line of code, switching models mid-run, or worrying about unsafe outputs. Whether you're producing art, media, marketing, or internal tools, RenderFluid gives you speed, control, and auditability—all with plug-and-play simplicity.

# 🎨 RenderFluid Illustration Pipeline – Quick Start Guide

The RenderFluid Illustration Pipeline is designed for fast, safe, and stylized AI image generation using the **PNY checkpoint**, a refined, SFW-only model based on RealCartoon-Pony. This workflow gives you plug-and-play control with built-in prompt templates, automatic safety filters, and a face detail pass—all with zero setup required.

If you’re looking to generate character art, concept pieces, or expressive stylized visuals that are appropriate for work and public use, this is the best place to start.

## ✅ Step 1: Launch the Workflow

In ComfyUI, go to the top menu and open:

```
Browse Templates → RenderFluid → Illustration → Stage One - PNY, Single Image _v2.0
```

This will load the full base pipeline for single-image generation with the PNY model. It’s already wired with the correct safety nodes, prompt sections, LoRA support, and face detail enhancements. No setup is needed—just plug in your prompt and hit **Queue Prompt** to generate.

## 🖼️ Stage One – Generate Your First Image

The Stage One pipeline is already preloaded with a working prompt, safety layers, and a default model. To get started quickly: **just hit Run**.

This will generate your first image using the RenderFluid PNY illustration checkpoint and a full wildcard-based prompt. Once you confirm everything is working, you can start customizing:

### 🔧 Step-by-Step Customization

1. **Prompt & Wildcards**  
   In the **Enter Prompt Here** node, you’ll see a complete prompt using wildcards. You can edit this directly or use the dropdown menus to insert new wildcard groups. These expand into randomized but curated terms to help vary your outputs or inspire new styles.

2. **Set Your Resolution**  
   In the **Set Image Size Here** section, choose from predefined resolution options. Each size is labeled with its aspect ratio (e.g., 16:9, 4:3). Use tall sizes like `768x1344` for portraits or wider sizes like `1280x720` for thumbnails or backgrounds.

3. **Checkpoints**  
   By default, the model is set to the RenderFluid PNY checkpoint. You can switch this in the **Set Checkpoint Here** node if you're working with a different model.

4. **LoRAs**  
   To add a LoRA, use the dropdown under **Select LoRA to add to the text**. LoRAs adjust the style or content of your generation and are automatically added to the prompt with the correct weight format. You can include more than one and adjust strength values to fine-tune the results.

## 🖌️ Step 2 – Initial Image Generation

Once your prompt and resolution are set, it's time to generate your first image. The **KSampler** node is what actually runs the AI model and turns your prompt into a final image.

You’ll see options like `steps`, `cfg`, `sampler_name`, and `scheduler`. These control the quality, randomness, and variation in your output. For most users, **there’s no need to adjust these**—you’ll get better results by experimenting with different **checkpoints** or **LoRAs** before touching sampler settings.

![Example Image](../../_bin/rf_instr_illustration_v1_0002.png)

If you want to tweak later:
- Increase **steps** (e.g. 20+) for more detail
- Adjust **cfg** (5–7.5 range is ideal) to control how strongly the model follows your prompt
- Change **sampler** types if you’re chasing a specific look

But for now, just run the image with default settings and review the results!

## ✨ Step 3 – Initial Face Detailer Pass

After the image is generated, RenderFluid runs a lightweight **Face Detailer** step. This module detects any visible faces and enhances them with extra detail, helping sharpen expressions and facial structure in illustration-style models.

![Example Image](../../_bin/rf_instr_illustration_v1_0008.png)

Illustration checkpoints often lack strong facial fidelity—so this step is important to ensure better results during the final upscale stages. That said, this **is not the final detailing pass**. It's optimized to inject just enough structure early on, without overprocessing or altering the artistic feel.

**Recommended:** Leave the settings as-is, or disable the node entirely if you're generating non-human subjects. You don’t need to make changes here unless you’re doing deep experimentation. The full detail enhancement happens later in the pipeline.

## 🔍 Step 4 – Initial Upscale Pass

Once the face detailing is complete, the image enters **Upscale – Stage 1**, where it is resized and cleaned up using an efficient upscaler (by default, `remacri_original.pt`). This step prepares the image for final output or further enhancement, depending on your needs.

![Example Image](../../_bin/rf_instr_illustration_v1_0012.png)

This stage uses **Lanczos** as the upscaling method and increases the image size by a factor of 1.5x. That’s often enough for **social media, concept art, or general use**. If you’re happy with the result, you can stop here and export the image. But if you want **maximum fidelity for print or high-resolution use**, this upscale provides a better base for later face and background detailers to work from.

### Key Settings:
- **upscale_method**: Controls the algorithm; Lanczos is fast and crisp.
- **scale_by**: Determines how much to increase the image size (1.5x default).
- **steps / cfg / denoise**: These affect quality and can be tuned, but the defaults are optimized for balance and speed.


## 🛡️ Step 5 – SFW Enforcement (Topggle Filter)

RenderFluid includes an integrated SFW enforcement layer powered by **NudeNet**, which automatically scans and flags NSFW content before it finishes rendering. This is designed for creators working in regulated or public-facing environments where safe outputs are critical.

![Example Image](../../_bin/rf_instr_illustration_v1_0004.png)

### How It Works:
The **Intercept NSFW Outputs** node uses the loaded `nudenet.onnx` model to evaluate each image. If any flagged content exceeds the **threshold** (default is `0.60`), the graph will be stopped before the image is finalized—ensuring nothing unsafe slips through.

- You can adjust the **threshold** to change sensitivity. A lower number catches more content, but may cause false positives.
- The current setup **kills the graph** for flagged content. This is the strictest and safest mode.

### Optional: Use Nudity Blur Instead of Kill
If you prefer to **blur** the flagged content instead of stopping the render, you can enable the **Apply NudeNet** node (currently disabled) and disable the Intercept node. This applies a **pixelation filter** to any flagged body parts using your selected filter list.

⚙️ You can modify what counts as NSFW in the **Filtered Labels** section. For example, if you want to allow bare feet but still block nudity, just toggle those options.

## 💾 Step 6 – Save the Image (with Metadata)

The final step in Stage One is handled by the **RF - Saver** module. This node saves your generated image to disk, embedding full metadata (seed, resolution, model, LoRA, prompt, and more) in the PNG file—making it easy to re-use or remix later.

![Example Image](../../_bin/rf_instr_illustration_v1_0007.png)

### Key Features:

- 📁 **Output Path:** Files are saved to `Render_Fluid_Output/rf_single_pass/` by default.
- 🧠 **Auto Naming:** Filenames include the model name, date, and time stamp for easy version tracking.
- 🧬 **Metadata Embedded:** You’ll retain all workflow details inside the image file—including the positive/negative prompts, model details, and config used.
- 🎨 **Seed and Size Recorded:** Ensures exact reproducibility if you want to regenerate the same image later.

This metadata is compatible with tools like CivitAI’s remix features and other ComfyUI pipelines that load from PNG files.

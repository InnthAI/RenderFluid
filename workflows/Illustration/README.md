# üé® RenderFluid Illustration Pipeline ‚Äì Quick Start Guide

The RenderFluid Illustration Pipeline is designed for fast, safe, and stylized AI image generation using the **PNY checkpoint**, a refined, SFW-only model based on RealCartoon-Pony. This workflow gives you plug-and-play control with built-in prompt templates, automatic safety filters, and a face detail pass‚Äîall with zero setup required.

If you‚Äôre looking to generate character art, concept pieces, or expressive stylized visuals that are appropriate for work and public use, this is the best place to start.

## ‚úÖ Step 1: Launch the Workflow

In ComfyUI, go to the top menu and open:

```
Browse Templates ‚Üí RenderFluid ‚Üí Illustration ‚Üí Stage One - PNY, Single Image _v2.0
```

This will load the full base pipeline for single-image generation with the PNY model. It‚Äôs already wired with the correct safety nodes, prompt sections, LoRA support, and face detail enhancements. No setup is needed‚Äîjust plug in your prompt and hit **Queue Prompt** to generate.

## üñºÔ∏è Stage One ‚Äì Generate Your First Image

The Stage One pipeline is already preloaded with a working prompt, safety layers, and a default model. To get started quickly: **just hit Run**.

This will generate your first image using the RenderFluid PNY illustration checkpoint and a full wildcard-based prompt. Once you confirm everything is working, you can start customizing:

### üîß Step-by-Step Customization

1. **Prompt & Wildcards**  
   In the **Enter Prompt Here** node, you‚Äôll see a complete prompt using wildcards. You can edit this directly or use the dropdown menus to insert new wildcard groups. These expand into randomized but curated terms to help vary your outputs or inspire new styles.

2. **Set Your Resolution**  
   In the **Set Image Size Here** section, choose from predefined resolution options. Each size is labeled with its aspect ratio (e.g., 16:9, 4:3). Use tall sizes like `768x1344` for portraits or wider sizes like `1280x720` for thumbnails or backgrounds.

3. **Checkpoints**  
   By default, the model is set to the RenderFluid PNY checkpoint. You can switch this in the **Set Checkpoint Here** node if you're working with a different model, such as JuggernautXL for photorealistic outputs.

4. **LoRAs**  
   To add a LoRA, use the dropdown under **Select LoRA to add to the text**. LoRAs adjust the style or content of your generation and are automatically added to the prompt with the correct weight format. You can include more than one and adjust strength values to fine-tune the results.

Once you're happy with your generation, continue on to the next stage to apply facial detail enhancements or skip ahead to upscaling.

# ðŸŽ¨ RenderFluid Illustration Pipeline â€“ Quick Start Guide

The RenderFluid Illustration Pipeline is designed for fast, safe, and stylized AI image generation using the **PNY checkpoint**, a refined, SFW-only model based on RealCartoon-Pony. This workflow gives you plug-and-play control with built-in prompt templates, automatic safety filters, and a face detail passâ€”all with zero setup required.

If youâ€™re looking to generate character art, concept pieces, or expressive stylized visuals that are appropriate for work and public use, this is the best place to start.

## âœ… Step 1: Launch the Workflow

In ComfyUI, go to the top menu and open:

```
Browse Templates â†’ RenderFluid â†’ Illustration â†’ Stage One - PNY, Single Image _v2.0
```

This will load the full base pipeline for single-image generation with the PNY model. Itâ€™s already wired with the correct safety nodes, prompt sections, LoRA support, and face detail enhancements. No setup is neededâ€”just plug in your prompt and hit **Queue Prompt** to generate.
